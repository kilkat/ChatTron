# ChatTron

**An Electron-based AI Chat Application for MCP Clients**

---

## 💡 Why I Started

I needed a simple and reliable chat interface that could interact with MCP. Instead of relying on unverified tools or code, I decided it would be better to develop one myself — which led to the creation of this project.
